# FitGirl-Repack-List
 Unofficial FitGirl ![Repack List](./RepackList.txt) and associated web-scrape script.
 
# Script usage
script.sh is a web-scraper that has two purposes, and is divided into two parts:
1. creating an updated `RepackList.txt` with a consise list of FitGirl repacks.
2. reading the `RepackList.txt` and for each entry create a consise `magnet.txt` in `~/links/fitgirl-repacks.site/<repackname>`.

# Script Limitations
This script takes a long time. It creates and filters through a list of nearly 3000 links, all of which need to be pulled from the source of a parent file.
